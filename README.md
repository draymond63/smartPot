# smartPot
Our project allows the user to get realtime data of their plant. 

This was submitted to the MakeUofT 2020 hackathon. 

### LCD Display

This allows plant data to be displayed to the user on a compact screen. 

### UV Sensor

This detects the amount of UV light reaching the plant and whether the plant is receiving enough, too much or too little sunlight. 

### Soil Moisture Sensor

This detects the moisture in the soil and whether the soil is too dry, perfect, or overwatered. 

### Tempature Sensor

This detects the ambient temperature surrounding the plant. 

### Sound Sensor

This detects sound input to trigger screen switches.
